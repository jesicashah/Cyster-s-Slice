## Cyster's Slice
### Every day is a struggle for us Cysters! 
My patisserie’s name suggests a celebration for each and every warrior fighting this illness unknown to many. 
This unseen illness isn’t noticed by everyone because PCOS is indistinguishable. 
But we at Cyster’s Slice are here to be a part of all your struggles and all your achievements. 
**You are not alone❤️🥰**
